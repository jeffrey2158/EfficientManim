# Contributing Guidelines

First off, thanks for considering contributing. You’re already a real one.

This project exists because of people like you—users, testers, writers, bug hunters, and code wizards. Whether you’re fixing a typo or shipping a major feature, you’re welcome here.

## Ways to Contribute

You can help in many ways:

* Reporting bugs
* Suggesting features or improvements
* Improving documentation
* Fixing issues or adding new features
* Reviewing pull requests
* Sharing feedback or ideas

No contribution is too small. Seriously.

---

## Before You Start

Please make sure you:

* Have read the **Code of Conduct**
* Check existing issues and pull requests to avoid duplicates
* Use clear, respectful communication

If you’re unsure about anything, open a discussion or issue first. It’s better to align early than rewrite later.

---

## Reporting Bugs

When reporting a bug, include:

* A clear and descriptive title
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Expected behavior vs actual behavior
* Screenshots, logs, or error messages if applicable
* Environment details (OS, Python version, browser, etc.)

Vague bug reports slow everyone down. Precision is king.

---

## Suggesting Features

Feature ideas are welcome.

When suggesting one, explain:

* The problem it solves
* Why it’s useful
* Any alternatives you’ve considered

Big ideas are cool. Clear reasoning is cooler.

## Pull Request Guidelines

A good PR:

* Has a clear title and description
* Explains *what* changed and *why*
* References related issues if applicable
* Passes all tests
* Does not include unrelated changes

Draft PRs are welcome if you want early feedback.

---

## Code Style

* Follow the existing code style and structure
* Keep things readable and maintainable
* Avoid unnecessary complexity
* Consistency > cleverness

Readable code ages better. Facts.
