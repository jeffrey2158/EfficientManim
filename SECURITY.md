# Security Policy

Security matters. If you find a vulnerability, we want to fix it—quietly, responsibly, and fast.

## Supported Versions

This project follows a simple support rule to keep things predictable.

| Version type                                                                       | Supported |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Latest stable release                                                              | Yes       |
| Pre-release / beta                                                                 | No        |
| Older versions                                                                     | No        |
| If you’re not on the latest stable version, upgrade first before reporting issues. |           |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security issues publicly** (issues, discussions, social media, etc.).

Instead, report them privately using one of the following methods:

* Email: **[geniussantu1983@gmail.com](mailto:geniussantu1983@gmail.com)**
  *(Replace with a real, monitored email before publishing)*

If email is not available, you may contact the maintainer directly via a private channel listed in the repository.

## What to Include

To help us resolve the issue quickly, include:

* A clear description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Potential impact (data loss, RCE, DoS, etc.)
* A proof of concept, if available

More details = faster fix.

---

## Response Timeline

You can expect:

* **Acknowledgement** within 72 hours
* **Initial assessment** within 7 days
* **Status updates** as progress is made

Timelines may vary depending on severity and complexity, but silence is not the plan.

---

## Disclosure Policy

If the vulnerability is accepted:

* We will work on a fix as quickly as possible
* We may request coordinated disclosure
* Credit will be given if desired

If the report is declined, we will explain why.

---

## Safe Harbor

We support responsible disclosure and will not take legal action against researchers who:

* Act in good faith
* Avoid data destruction and privacy violations
* Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond proof of concept

Hack responsibly. We’re on the same side.
